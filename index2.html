  <p style="font-size: 27px; padding: 25px;">'Bal Bharati vidyamandir' the very name reflects the ideology of the founders that the school will be a temple of learning and all efforts will be aimed at making the school a miniature model of Bharat and thus the institution aims to bring about the all round development of a child's personality and to develop the institution into an ideal 'community school' based on mutual co-operation between the school and the local community.<br><br>
This institution was established on 18th June 1962, the Revolution Day, immediately after the Goa liberation on 19th December 1961 and was managed by Bal Bharati Vidyamandir Trust founded by shri Gurunath V. Shetye of Raibandar - Goa. Initially for almost thirteen years the school conducted the classes in different private rented/rent free houses at various locations such as Chimbel, Fondvem, Patto etc. The founder Shri Gurunath V. Shetye donated a part of his share of his ancestral property admeasuring 2560sqm where the construction of the school building was undertaken and the first phase was completed in 1975, the second phase was completed in 1985 where as the third phase was completed in 1995. 
<br><br>In 1998, the school has been handed over to Manipal Academy of Health and Education (MAHE), the educational body founded by Shri. Ramesh V. Pai, the "Pai of Manipal‚Äù who are highly regarded as the pioneer and visionary in the field of education not only in India but all over the world. Under the able leadership and guidance of the MAHE, the school has provided additional facilities such as play ground, independent buildings for primary as well as pre-primary school. The pre-primary is well equipped with playing cum learning materials thus creating an environment where children learn through play and enjoy themselves. The massive school with the spacious well ventilated classrooms, library, Audiovisual hall, auditorium, computer lab, science lab, music room and a huge playground as well as its environmental scenic beauty encourages and provides students with an environment conducive for learning with joy and satisfaction.
<br><br>Every child is unique and has great potentials within them and thus all the students are given equal and enough scope to take part in all sorts of countless curricular and co-curricular activities by which they develop confidence and bring out the best in them to face the new world with great zeal and vigour.
Through Eco-Science club and Consumer club the students are given an opportunity to participate in various environment related activities and competitions there by giving them practical experience of life.
The students have also made the institution proud by bringing accolades by participating and winning prizes in various academics and co-curricular activities like Art, music, theatre art, elocutions, seminars, quizzes, Dramas, NTSE, GTSE, MCT, Sports etc.
The name and fame that the school has acquired since 1962 has been a tradition and all efforts are being made by the management as well as the teaching and non-teaching staff not only to maintain it but also to take it to the greater heights.
